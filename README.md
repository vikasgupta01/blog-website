# blog-website

This is a blog sharing website having option of creating posts from compose, getting a glance of it's content and heading from home page, and viewing them individually through dynamically rendered ejs pages for each blog.

It's an ongoing project and currently it uses node.js with express, ejs and lodash.

It stores the blog data in array for now, but I'm planning to give it database connectivity as well; so that we would be able to preserve the blog data post session.
